  <div class="container">
    <h3 class="new">The Boy Who Cried Wolf</h3>
    <p>
      A shepherd boy repeatedly tricks villagers into thinking a wolf is attacking his flock.
      When a wolf actually appears, no one believes him. The moral: Liars are not believed even when they tell the truth.

  <div class="container">
    <h3 class="trending">The Tortoise and the Hare</h3>
    <p>
      A speedy hare mocks a slow-moving tortoise. They race, and the hare, overconfident, naps during the race.
      The tortoise wins by steady and consistent progress. The moral: Slow and steady wins the race.
